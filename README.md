# Data Science Learning Progress

This repository tracks my **weekly progress in learning Data Science**, from Python basics to exploratory data analysis (EDA) and introductory machine learning (ML).  
I follow a structured weekly plan, completing exercises, tutorials, and small projects in Jupyter notebooks.  

The goal is to systematically build skills and create a portfolio of hands-on projects.
