# Week 1 â€” Python, NumPy, Pandas, Visualization

This week I focused on strengthening my Python skills for data science and learning the essential tools: **NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn**.  
Each day I completed small projects and Jupyter notebooks. Below is the summary.

- **Notebook:** [python_day_1.ipynb](day_1_python.ipynb)

### Day 2 â€” NumPy
- Learned array creation, indexing, slicing, reshaping, and random number generation.
- Practiced arithmetic operations, dot product, and computing mean/variance manually.
- Performed simple matrix operations (addition, element-wise multiplication, matrix multiplication).
- Filtered arrays and worked with boolean indexing.
- **Notebook:** [python_day_2.ipynb](day_2_numpy.ipynb)

### Day 3 â€” Pandas Basics
- Learned how to load CSV files, inspect dataframes, filter rows, select columns.
- Started exploring IMDb Top 250 Movies dataset.
